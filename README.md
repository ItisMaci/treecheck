# 🌳 treecheck  

**treecheck** is a simple C++ console application designed to explore how binary trees work.  
It reads a binary tree from a file and performs basic checks and analyses.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **AVL Check:** Determines if a given binary tree is an **AVL tree** (height-balanced).  
- ✅ **Subtree Check:** Checks whether a second tree is a **subtree** of the first.  
- ✅ **Tree Statistics:** Prints useful stats about the structure of the tree.  

## 🛠 How It Works  

Run **treecheck** with one or two file arguments:  

```sh
treecheck file1
```
➡️ Reads `file1`, constructs a binary tree, and checks if it is an **AVL tree**.  

```sh
treecheck file1 file2
```
➡️ Reads two binary trees from `file1` and `file2`, then checks if the second tree is a **subtree** of the first.  

## 🖥️ Development  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Purpose:** A learning project to understand binary trees and AVL properties  
- **Type:** Console-based application  

## 📂 Input Format  
##Each file should contain single integer value in each line.##
